Solution work for Advent of Code 2017, using Elixir

## Organization

Single files for each day, with a possible `dayXb.ex` file for the second part of the challenge if I
didn't refactor the original implementation.

## How to Use

Run `mix test` to run doctests for all solutions and validate that they work as intended.
